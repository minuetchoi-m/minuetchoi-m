```
Images go through my mind of laughing wondering
When we were young what love would bring
Cold and snowy days, tender first embrace
We had everything, all that life could mean

Forbidden like a precious jewel you couldn't see
That I need only you as you needed me
Then I showed you how with my heart and soul
From that moment on forever we'd lived as one

Then you went away it broke my heart
You were my life right from the start
Smile again
Though you were gone I never could believe
Smile again
You'd just let me lonely
Smile again
Because I know your spirit lives in me until eternity
Smile again

Our child gave me reason to live
Memories of you time couldn't heal

Smile again
All the things they said were never true
Smile again
We can start a new
Smile again
Because I knew your spirit lives in me until eternity
Smile again
