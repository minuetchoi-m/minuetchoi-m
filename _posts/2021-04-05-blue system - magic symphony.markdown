Breaking down the fences - breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat - mystery is a fool
I talk to my dream
 
I hear a voice, it was calling
And I couldn't stop to steam
'Cause my wild horse was falling
Give me freedom in my dreams
 
Give me shelter, yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die
It's a magic symphony
 
Baby, when you're lying next to me
I hear violins
You know what it means just for tonight
I hear a symphony of love
 
I see the stars - the moon above
I hear your heart - I feel your touch deep down inside
Breaking down the fences - breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat - mystery is a fool
 
I talk in my sleep
It was a mystic tune, devotion
I hear the rhythmn ........ beat
Unknown soldiers in devotion
 
Give me freedom in my dreams
Give me shelter - yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die
