```
You are just my fantasy boy
I made you up, you were my toy
And I found you as a dream inside my head
Your eyes are like a mystic dream
The deepest blue I've ever seen
You're a mixture of the new man and gypsy

(*)
Tell me why tell me why you're so real when I dream.
Don't you know I have to face reality- oh-oh-oh

(**)
Fantasy boy, has been my lover, not my toy  
Cause I need you to be real, to be no fantasy
I want to touch and feel.
My fantasy boy come on and step into my life
It's so much harder to survive.
Without your love for me. And take me to etermity

I know some day I'm gonna meet,
Fantasy boy, I feel your heat,
Want to squeeze you, tease you, hold you in my arms.

Tell me why tell me why you're so real when I dream.
Don't you know I have to face reality- oh-oh-oh

Fantasy boy, has been my lover, not my toy  
Cause I need you to be real, to be no fantasy

It's so much harder to survive.
Without your love for me. And take me to etermity  

My Fantasy boy...
