```
Lost in the middle of a jungle
Sending an SOS to the world
Lonely on an island
In the middle of the sea

I hear a stranger's voice around me
A savage woman looks to my eyes
But I know this, baby
She's the woman of

And I fall in love with her
To follow in paradise
She's the kind of girl I love
She's the girl of my dreams

But tonight arrives and she
Goes so far away from me
I don't know where she sits by
Please don't go from my side

Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh
I will miss you forever
Bye bye mi amor - my baby
Don't you leave me tonight

Bye bye mi amor - ohohoh
I will miss you forever
Bye bye mi amor - my baby
Don't you leave me tonight

I don't know if I am only dreaming
But I'm dreming really surprised
Now I can believe it
But she's in front of me

I hear a stranger's voice around me
A savage woman looks to my eyes
But I know this, baby
She's the woman of

And I fall in love with her
To follow in paradise
She's the kind of girl I love
She's the girl of my dreams

But tonight arrives and she
Goes so far away from me
I don't know where she sits by
Please don't go from my side

And I fall in love with her
To follow in paradise
She's the kind of girl I love
She's the girl of my dreams

But tonight arrives and she
Goes so far away from me
I don't know where she sits by
Please don't go from my side
