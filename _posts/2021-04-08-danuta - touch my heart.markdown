Touch me

Where is the sun I'm waiting for?
Where is the one that I adore?
So hear me cry, where is your love?
I need emotion (I need emotion)
Ten thousand miles away from you
There is the girl that waits for you
So take a chance or I will die
I can't wait forever, take me to the life

[Chorus]
Touch, my heart
Where's the man
Who will hold me and love me forever?
Touch, my love
Let me know that you want me
And let's stay together
Touch, my heart, 
Touch, my love 

I'm sitting here, I'm all alone
I need to have you on the phone
I feel so cold, the night is gray
I'm so sad and lonely (so sad and lonely)
Where is the one I long to see?
Where are the nights of ecstasy?
So take a chance, don't make me cry
I can't wait forever, take me to the life

[Chorus: x2]

Hold me
So sad and lonely 
Fantasy
Fantasy
I can't wait forever, take me to the life

[Chorus]

Touch, my heart
Touch, my love

[Chorus]
