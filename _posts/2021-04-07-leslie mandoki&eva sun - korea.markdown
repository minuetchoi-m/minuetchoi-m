The sun's burning down a sweet emotion
Flying up higher, reach out for more
We're all running faster for lovely smiles
Higher and higher, we fall in love
 
I need your love, my long-distance girl
The ocean is wide. We're builsing a bridge
I wonder why can't we be faster than light,
Faster than airplanes,
My precious love
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Games are forever
 
Just getting up, you go to sleep
Thousands of miles, so far away
I'm working so hard
To make the games,
To get down to Seoul
See you again!
 
I need your love, my long-distance girl
The ocean is wide. We're building a bridge
I wonder why can't we be faster than light,
Faster than airplanes,
My precious love
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Games are forever
 
Ah ah~ ah ah~
Ah ah~ ah ah~
Ah~ ah~ ahah~ ah
 
I wonder why can't we be faster than light,
Faster than airplanes,
My precious love
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Games are forever
 
Ah ah~ ah ah~
Ah ah~ ah ah~
Ah~ ah~ ahah~ ah
 
[Eva's Humming melody of "Arirang", A korean traditional song]
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Games are forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Loves are forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Games are forever
 
When the sun comes up in Korea,
The sun goes down in America
When the sun comes up in Korea,
Love lasts forever
