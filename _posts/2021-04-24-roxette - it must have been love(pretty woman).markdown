It must have been love
But it's over now
Lay a whisper
On my pillow
Leave the winter
On the ground
I wake up lonely
There's air of silence
In the bedroom
And all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow

It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing
We're together
That I'm sheltered
By your heart
But in and outside
I turned to water
Like a teardrop
In your palm

And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away
It must have been love
But it's over now
It was all that I wanted
Now, I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love
But it's over now
It was all that I wanted
Now, I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows
It must have been love
But it's over now

It must have been love
But it's over now
