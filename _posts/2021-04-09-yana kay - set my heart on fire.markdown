The day is dying, my soul is crying
I’m barely trying to find your missing traits
The stars are winking and heart is sinking
But I keep searching in this velvet haze
Your eyes, your face
 
Set my heart on fire
It’s my only one desire
Hold me in your arms again
And make me feel this flame
 
The rain is pouring, your voice not calling
The time is crawling from me, it’s eating days
But I keep waiting, anticipating
That moment when I find in velvet haze
Your eyes, your face
 
Set my heart on fire
It’s my only one desire
Hold me in your arms again
And make me feel this flame
 
Set my heart on fire
It’s my only one desire
Hold me in your arms again
And make me feel this flame
Set my heart on fire
 
Nana nanana…
Nana nanana…
 
Nana nanana…
Nana nanana…
Nana nanana…
 
Set my heart on fire
It’s my only one desire
Hold me in your arms again
And make me feel this flame
 
Set my heart on fire
It’s my only one desire
Hold me in your arms again
And make me feel this flame
Set my heart on fire
