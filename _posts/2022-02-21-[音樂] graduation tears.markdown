And now is the time to say good bye to the books
And the people who have guided me along
They showed me the way to joy and happiness, my friends,
How can I forget the fun we had before

I don't know how I would go on without you in a wicked world
I'll be all alone I've been blessed by school life
Don't care about a thing
Gotta thank our teachers and my friends

Graduation tears congratulation cheers.
It's the day of my emotion, can you see
Who'd know the friendship and love I'll leave behind.
As I step out of the schoolyard I have known

I don't know how I would go on without you in a wicked world
I'll be all alone I've been blessed by school life
Don't care about a thing
Gotta thank our teachers and my friends
